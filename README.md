This is an entry in https://www.shroudoftheavatar.com/?p=39149, a contest to port a BASIC program
written by Richard Garriott (creator of Ultima) circa 1977 to modern infrastructure.

This entry is JavaScript and runs in a browser. Rather than port a bunch of BASIC code, I decided
to write a simple BASIC interpreter in JavaScript using jison. It's not very fast, efficient, and
is missing a lot of error-checking, but it seems to work.

Demo URL forthcoming.
